## Tech I Used
This app is purely made with vanilla JavaScript & raw HTML/CSS. 
A very important technique of javascript is used here. That is debouncing. 
debounce() function causes a function to run only after a specific intreval. It is used often with resource intensive event like scroll, mousemove etc to overcome the overhead. As these events fire very frequetly they causes serious overhead, the debounce() function allows to run the function after the event fire at a specific time period.
